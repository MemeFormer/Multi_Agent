## Advice and Implementation Plan for a Personal Multi-Agent AI Code Editor

Below is a proposal on how to configure and utilize an AI model as an effective “editor agent,” together with recommended operations for code refactoring tasks and a set of test cases to ensure its reliability.

## 1. Recommended Instructions for the Editor Agent

- Clearly define the agent’s responsibilities: managing file edits, executing bash commands, and coordinating with other agents (e.g., JuniorEngineer, SeniorEngineer).
- Provide full context (e.g., existing code files, directory structure, user instructions) before requesting changes.
- Request confirmation from a reviewer agent (SeniorEngineer) when executing changes that could significantly impact the codebase.
- Implement safeguards to ensure correctness (e.g., verifying the effect of changes before committing).

## 2. Top 10 Common Operations for Refactoring Tasks

1. Add or remove lines in a file (e.g., updating function names, docstrings, or imports).
2. Replace a string with another string in one or more files (search/replace).
3. Rename files or directories to align with new conventions.
4. Move or copy files to re-organize code structure.
5. Create new files or directories for reorganizing modules.
6. Delete obsolete files or directories after verifying no dependencies.
7. Execute installation or dependency updates with package managers (e.g., pip, npm).
8. Run test commands (e.g., bash commands like “pytest tests/”).
9. Checkout branches, merge branches, or revert commits (Git operations).
10. Modify environment variables or .env files to configure different runtime settings.

## 3. Test Cases for Evaluating Effectiveness

1. File Edit Accuracy: Request the agent to insert a new function in a specific file and verify that it appears correctly.
2. Batch String Replacement: Ask the agent to replace a function name across multiple files, then confirm the changes using a diff tool.
3. Directory Restructuring: Instruct the agent to rename a folder and ensure all import references are updated accordingly.
4. Creation/Deletion of Files: Have the agent create new placeholder modules and remove deprecated ones without breaking references.
5. Multi-step Bash Command Execution: Instruct the agent to install a new package, run tests, and remove the package if no longer needed.
6. Git Workflow Commands: Request the agent to switch branches, merge, or revert commits, verifying results via git status logs.
7. Environment Configuration: Provide instructions to update environment variables in a .env file and confirm changes by reading them.
8. Rollback Mechanisms: Evaluate how well the agent can revert a change that introduced errors.
9. Code Analysis & Suggestions: Ask the agent to analyze code vulnerabilities or performance issues and propose fixes that can be verified by the SeniorEngineer.
10. Collaboration with Review Agents: Confirm that the agent can coordinate with the SeniorEngineer when changes are potentially disruptive.

## 4. Emphasis on Translating Requests into Bash Commands

- Ensure the editor agent can interpret instructions accurately, execute them in a controlled environment, and present outcomes (e.g., command output logs) to the user and the SeniorEngineer.
- Maintain a clear audit trail of commands executed, changes made, and verification results for transparency.

By following these guidelines, you can set up a robust “editor agent” that seamlessly handles file edits, executes relevant bash commands, and collaborates with other specialized agents in your multi-agent architecture.

## Multi-Agent Architecture Analysis and Framework Recommendations

Based on your fascinating experience with Gemini 2.5 and your prototype system, I see tremendous potential in formalizing this approach. Here's my analysis and recommendations for building a framework that captures the "magic formula" you've discovered.

## 1. Key Insights from Your Experience

What you've discovered aligns with emerging research on AI agent specialization:

- **Separation of concerns**: Planning agent (Gemini) vs. Execution agent (Cursor Agent Mode)
- **Controlled autonomy**: Stripping the execution agent of independent decision-making
- **Clear communication protocol**: Structured task descriptions between agents
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight**: Your ability to course-correct or approve plans
- **Specialized knowledge domains**: Different models handling different aspects of the workflow

## 2. Proposed Framework Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Planner Agent**
   - Responsible for high-level strategy and plan formulation
   - Maintains the big picture understanding of the codebase
   - Breaks down complex tasks into atomic operations
   - Integrates user feedback into revised plans

2. **Editor Agent**
   - Executes precise file operations following structured instructions
   - Limited decision-making scope (focuses on "how" not "what")
   - Provides factual observations without acting on them
   - Returns execution results in a standardized format

3. **Reviewer Agent** (your SeniorEngineer)
   - Verifies safety and correctness of proposed operations
   - Static analysis of potential issues
   - Authorization gatekeeper for execution

4. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Manages the conversation flow between agents
   - Handles context windowing challenges
   - Maintains state across the entire interaction session

## 3. API Integration Opportunities

Your logs show you're already using some advanced techniques. Here are more to consider:

1. **System Prompts & Role Definition**
   - Use system prompts to enforce the separation of concerns
   - Example: "You are an Editor Agent. You will only execute the specific commands given to you. Do not make decisions about what should be done."

2. **JSON Mode & Structured Outputs**
   - Standardize communication between agents using JSON schemas
   - Define schemas for "Plan", "Command", "Observation", and "Verification"

3. **Function Calling**
   - Define available operations as function signatures
   - Example: `edit_file(file_path, operation_type, parameters)`

4. **Parallel Processing**
   - Use async calls to process multiple file operations concurrently
   - Implement a dependency graph for operations that must be sequential

5. **Streaming Responses**
   - Stream planning agent thoughts to maintain user engagement during complex tasks
   - Stream file content changes for real-time feedback

6. **Token Optimization**
   - Implement efficient context summarization for long sessions
   - Use embeddings to retrieve only relevant code snippets when needed

## 4. Next Development Phases

Based on your current prototype, I recommend these next steps:

### Phase 3: Enhanced Agent Communication

1. Design a formal communication protocol between agents
2. Implement structured JSON message passing
3. Add explicit reasoning chains in the planning agent's output

### Phase 4: Expanded Testing Suite

1. Add complex refactoring scenarios (class restructuring, API changes)
2. Test with diverse codebases (different languages, project structures)
3. Implement "chain of verification" checks after execution

### Phase 5: User Experience Layer

1. Create an intuitive interface for plan review and modification
2. Add visualization of proposed changes before execution
3. Implement session management for long-running refactoring tasks

This framework has significant potential not just for refactoring tasks but for a wide range of software engineering workflows. The approach elegantly addresses the key limitations of current AI assistants by creating specialized roles with clear boundaries.

Your current prototype shows promising results, and formalizing this approach could lead to a truly revolutionary developer experience.

## Role Optimization for Multi-Agent Architecture

You've hit on a critical insight about optimizing your multi-agent system. Let me outline how to restructure the roles to maximize efficiency and leverage each model's strengths.

## Current vs. Optimized Role Distribution

### Current Structure (Bottom-Up)

```
Junior Engineer (Llama) → Proposes solutions → Senior Engineer (Deepseek) → Reviews/Approves
```

### Optimized Structure (Top-Down)

```
Senior Engineer (Deepseek) → Creates strategic plan → Junior Engineer (Llama) → Executes tactical steps
```

## Implementation Plan for Role Reversal

### 1. Redefine Agent Responsibilities

**Senior Engineer (Deepseek):**

- Strategic planning and problem decomposition
- Code analysis and understanding the codebase structure
- Breaking down complex tasks into atomic operations
- Creating a sequenced execution plan with clear checkpoints
- Proactively identifying potential issues and edge cases

**Junior Engineer (Llama):**

- Executing precise operations as instructed
- Reporting results back in a structured format
- Requesting clarification when needed
- Providing observations about execution outcomes
- Learning from the Senior's approach over time

### 2. Revise Conversation Flows

1. **Task Initialization:**
   - User submits task
   - Senior analyzes codebase and requirement
   - Senior creates execution plan with step-by-step instructions

2. **Execution Phase:**
   - Junior receives one instruction at a time
   - Junior executes and reports outcomes
   - Senior validates results before proceeding to next step

3. **Review Phase:**
   - Senior validates overall completion against original requirements
   - User receives summary of changes and outcomes

### 3. Update System Prompts

**New Senior Engineer System Prompt:**

```
You are a Senior Software Engineer responsible for planning and oversight. 
Your job is to:
1. Analyze the codebase and understand the task requirements
2. Create a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementation
3. Provide clear, precise instructions to the Junior Engineer who will execute them
4. Verify each step's results before proceeding to the next
5. Ensure the overall solution meets requirements and follows best practices

Use your expertise to anticipate problems and create robust plans that maximize the Junior Engineer's effectiveness.
```

**New Junior Engineer System Prompt:**

```
You are a Junior Software Engineer focusing on execution. 
Your job is to:
1. Follow the Senior Engineer's instructions precisely
2. Execute one command or operation at a time
3. Report results in a structured format
4. Ask for clarification if instructions are ambiguous
5. Do not make strategic decisions or deviate from the given plan

Your strength is in accurate execution of specific tasks, not overall planning.
```

### 4. Code Structure Updates

1. Modify `src/agents/senior_engineer.py`:
   - Add planning capabilities (task decomposition, strategy development)
   - Implement step sequencing logic
   - Add validation of execution results

2. Modify `src/agents/junior_engineer.py`:
   - Simplify decision-making logic
   - Enhance execution reporting
   - Add standardized "observation" output format

3. Update `src/main.py`:
   - Reverse the agent interaction flow
   - Add iterative execution loop for multi-step plans

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Cognitive Load Optimization:**
   - Planning model (Deepseek) handles the complex thinking
   - Execution model (Llama) focuses on precise implementation

2. **Reduced Error Rate:**
   - Junior no longer needs to understand the full problem space
   - Simpler instructions lead to more accurate execution

3. **Improved Control Flow:**
   - Clear hierarchy with defined responsibilities
   - Natural checkpoint system for verification

4. **Scalability:**
   - Senior can plan multiple parallel tracks of work
   - Multiple Junior agents could execute different parts simultaneously

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate (1-2 days):**
   - Update system prompts and test in manual mode
   - Prototype new conversation flow without code changes

2. **Short-term (3-5 days):**
   - Modify agent code to implement role reversal
   - Create updated test cases to validate new approach

3. **Medium-term (1-2 weeks):**
   - Implement feedback mechanisms for failed steps
   - Add ability for Senior to revise plans based on execution results

This role optimization aligns perfectly with how human software teams often operate - with senior developers creating architecture and plans that junior developers then implement with guidance. It leverages each AI model's strengths while compensating for their limitations.
